# Christmas-Lights (ver 1.0)
A small Processing game by Luis Wong (luis@luiswong.com)

Student project - ENJMIN M1 - 2015


The object of the game is to have as most light as possible, by turning them on when they are dimming. 
If most lights are off, the amount of light will go down and you will lose.
 
I used an Object Oriented Programming approach for creating a Light class (creating methods and for creating a 2D array of this objects), used the lightning() function for total lightning bar. Finally I added some text and sound using Pfont and the Minim library. The game was inspired by the newsgame Madrid, by Gonzalo Frasca.

For restarting the game you have to play again the Processing file.
I will work on a reinit() function soon.

This project was made for a student project where the object was to make a Processing program with a Christmas theme.
